How much does it cost to build a website in Nigeria.

![How much does it cost to build a website in Nigeria](/media/img-price-nig.jpg)

To build a website there are two things to consider, type of website and who is developing it.

### Types of websites
- Static Website
- Dynamic Website

**Static Website** are basic website. They are not interactive, though they can be responsive with good user interface. Users can't update the content only the developer. In general they are information base websites, where you visit to read contents only no interactions.

**Dynamic Website** are secondary website whose content is regularly updated. It's is automated that different information can be pass to different users on the same website. That's where you find features like login, logout, registration, profile update, online payment, location, picture upload and so on. No wonder, we interact with the websites of this kind much more often than with static ones, just because the internet users want much more from a web resource than just some information.

### Who is developing the website
- Freelancer
- Web Design Agency
- Website Builder / By Yourself

**Freelancer** is a person who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term.

**Web Design Agency** is a company/organization that will handle the whole development of your website.

**Website Builder** Website builders are tools that typically allow the construction of websites without manual code editing. 

**By Yourself** building website yourself by writing the code yourself. (I'll be writing a blog soon on how to build your own website and how to host for free stay tune)

Now that we have details on building a website, How much does it cost actually cost to build a website for each of *who is developing it*.

These details doesn't include, price for domain name, Web hosting or any integration subscription. Also not the exact price for any of the *who is developing*, it varies depending on the level of skill for the freelancer and the strength of the web agency company. What i'm giving here is just an heads up of what to expect ahead.
