To build a website there are two things to consider, type of website and who is developing it.

### Type of websites
- Staic Website
- Dynamic Website

Static Website are the basic ones. They don’t often change their content and they aren’t updated by users. Mostly, websites of this kind are made for information goals rather than interactions.

Dynamic Website are the ones whose content is regularly updated. Even more, different users often see different information. Remember your experience with any e-commerce website: what you see at a particular opening a website depends on multiple factors such as location, your search history, your being logged-in or logged-out, the relevance of some positions to the season or hot sales and so on, and so forth. Analyzing all that stuff, the website has to update its content. What’s more, users may generate some content by themselves or customize what they want to see with filters, tags and the like – in this case, the website will have to respond to all the actions dynamically and show the updated content to users. No wonder, we interact with the websites of this kind much more often than with static ones, just because the internet users want much more from a web resource than just some information.
